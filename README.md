TwentyOne is a game for 1 to 4 players, each starting with a specific amount of money. The goal is to beat the dealer by getting as close to twenty-one points as possible without exceeding it. Here's how the game works:

1. Each player takes turns, placing bets against the dealer.
2. Random numbers between 1 and 11 are generated to simulate card values.
3. After each number is drawn, players decide whether to draw another card to increase their total points or stop.
4. Players win if they reach exactly 21 points or if the dealer busts (goes over 21).
5. In case of a tie with the dealer, players neither win nor lose their bet.
6. Players must have enough money to place a bet; otherwise, they'll be prompted to enter a valid bet amount.
7. If a player's bank reaches 0, they are skipped.
8. The game continues until all players decide to cash out or play again.
